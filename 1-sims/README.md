## Simulations to evaluate the randomization test


### Selection bias simulations

Code and information on the selection bias simulations are provided in the `b-selection-bias' directory.

### Horizontal pleiotropy simulations

Code and information on the horizontal pleiotroyp simulations are provided in the `c-horizontal-pleiotropy' directory.


### Generic functions

The `generic-functions' directory contains useful functions (called from other scripts) that are used in multiple places in this repository.

It also contains the code for a speed test where we compared calculating the unadjusted association between two variables 
(i.e. mean difference of the outcome per 1 unit higher exposure) using linear regression vs a correlation approach.


Note that the `a-branson-basic' directory contains some code used to initially try out the randomization test, such that this 
code is not used in the analysis reported in the accompanying paper.
