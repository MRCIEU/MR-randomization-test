## Speed test


This directory contains the code for a speed test where we compared calculating the unadjusted association between two variables
(i.e. mean difference of the outcome per 1 unit higher exposure) using linear regression vs a correlation approach.

The speed test is run on BlueCrystal phase 4 with the command:

```bash
sbatch j-speed.sh
```
